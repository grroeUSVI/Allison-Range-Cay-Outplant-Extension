This is a very preliminary cleaning of Allisons range cay monitoring, basic plot of the proportion of trees that survived and a chi squred test looking for differences in survivorship between treatments at the 17 month time point. 



This might be useful to look at if you want an idea of how to start cleaning and visualizing a dataset. 

Megan and Lorely have been working with this data more and analyzed for differences in survivorship at a different time point. They have code exploring this information more.
